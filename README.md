#### About
This is Instanews. 
This webpage allows you to view New York Times top 12 news from 6 different categories using NYT API. Iâ€™ve used filter and splice properties in order to only view articles that have images and limit the amount of responses to 12. I used the heapbox plugin in order to create a great looking selection menu.

The webpage is optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, tablet and desktop. Flexbox is used in order to create beautiful article grid with properly scaled background images. 

Animation is used in order to view captions for the articles on hover as well as change the header size when results are loaded.While the results are loading, there is also a loading gif to update users on the process.
